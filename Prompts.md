**Project:** AiDevtest
**Goal:** Create a basic but deployable notes app for mobile and web. Users can auth via firebase, create edit and delete basic text notes, notes are stored in firebase.
**Tech stack:** Flutter + Firebase Auth. VS Code IDE, git / github version control 
**Current step:** Build a boilerplate to starting point
**Key decisions:** Keep it super simple, just an empty app that launches on all platforms for now
**Next request:** Next we will set up firebase ready for auth
